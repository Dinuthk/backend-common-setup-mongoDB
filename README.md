The cookie-parser middleware is commonly used in Node.js applications to handle cookies. It parses the cookies attached to client requests and makes them accessible as an object for easy manipulation. Here's a detailed explanation of why you might install and use it:

Why Install cookie-parser?
Parse Cookies Easily: Cookies are sent by the browser as a string in the Cookie header. cookie-parser simplifies the process by converting this string into a JavaScript object that can be accessed in your server code.

Access and Manipulate Cookies: Once the cookies are parsed, you can easily read their values, check for specific cookies, or use their data for application logic.

Handle Signed Cookies: cookie-parser supports signed cookies, which are cookies that have been tamper-proofed using a secret key. This ensures that the cookie values cannot be modified by the client without detection.

Integration with Other Middleware: Many frameworks and libraries rely on cookies for session management, authentication, and user preferences. cookie-parser provides an easy way to manage cookies in conjunction with these tools.

Improve Readability and Maintainability: Without cookie-parser, you would have to manually parse the raw cookie string, which can be tedious and error-prone. cookie-parser abstracts this complexity, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.
